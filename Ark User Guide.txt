#### Identifying your Ark Wallet Address

Your Ark Wallet address is presented to you at the top of the client, under 'Address' and to the left of the *Copy* icon. This address is 100% unique to your wallet. You will need this address in the future to send Ark to your wallet. You can automatically copy is by simply clicking on it.

### Sending Ark to your Ark Wallet (*from an exchange*)

1. First you will need to buy some Ark, which is available across many exchanges today and growing regularly. You can find a list of exchanges here:

https://ark.io/exchanges

2. Once you've purchased some Ark via an exchange you will be ready to send your Ark to your Ark Wallet.

3. In this example we are withdrawing from Bittrex. Each exchange is unique in its own way, but withdrawing will generally follow the same steps. Click on the '-' icon in Bittrex to begin your withdrawal.

4. You will be presented with a 'Confirm Ark Withdrawal' page. Enter your Ark address to your wallet (simply click on the address in your Ark Desktop Application, within your wallet) and paste. Then, enter the amount of Ark you'd like to send to your Ark Wallet. Then select "Withdrawal", and "Confirm" the transaction.

**Note:** Bittrex, like many exchanges, will send you an email that you need to open and select a link in to confirm the transaction. This is a typical security measure most exchanges perform. 

5. Your Ark will be sent on it's way to your Ark Wallet! You will soon be able to see your new Ark balance in the Ark Desktop Application!

### Sending Ark from your Ark Wallet

Now that your have a balance of Ark in your wallet, you may want to send it out. Someone may want to send Ark to another Ark address for any number of reasons, perhaps you want to sell your Ark, pay for a good or service, or donate Ark to the Ark Community Fund. Sending Ark is quick & easy. 

1. Within your Ark Desktop Application and within your wallet, you will see an arrow pointing to the right in the top right hand corner of the Ark address box. This is the send icon. Select it. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YI4EztD.png)

2. Now you are in the send box. The 1st line you see will be the Ark address line you are *sending* your Ark to. To the left of the line is a QR Scan function. If you click it (and have a web cam hooked up to your computer) you will be able to scan the QR code of the Ark address you wish to send to and the address will automatically propagate to the Ark address line. Otherwise you will simply copy and paste the address you're sending to.

3. The next line is the amount of Ark you wish to send. If you'd like to send you're entire balance select the "SEND ALL" option and your entire balance will propagate to that line.

4. Smartbridge data is not required. It can be used in specific and unique instances. Ignore it at this time.

5. The final line is where you will enter your passphrase. Your passphrase must be entered exactly as it was presented to you. It is all lower case, 12 words, 1 space between each word, and no space at the end. 

6. When you're ready to send select "NEXT". 

7. You'll now see a Transaction box, confirm all information is correct and select "SEND < > NOW"

8. All done! Your Ark is on its way to its destination address!

### Voting with your Ark Wallet

Voting or otherwise known as staking your Ark has several purposes. By voting for a delegate you help secure the Ark network (most importantly), and the lure of voting is that most delegates provide an incentive for voting for them by rewarding you with Ark on a periodic basis (amount and how often paid differs between delegates). Some think of this as interest earned for their Ark. 

Each delegate is unique and brings different skill sets to the Ark Ecosystem, so before voting for who you think should be entrusted with securing the Ark network you should do your due diligence and research the delegates. More information about the delegates and frequently asked questions regarding voting and delegates can be found in the FAQ and Links section towards the bottom of this User Guide. 

1. Within your Ark Wallet you wish to Vote with, select the "VOTES" tab, located directly beneath your wallet address box. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c6ilspm.png)

2. You will now see a blue box that says "VOTE" within it, select it.

3. A new box will appear labeled "Vote". The first selection is a drop down labeled "Active delegates (forging)". Select it. 

4. You will now see a list of the top 51 delegates that are currently forging Ark. (*learn more about what this means in FAQ*)

5. For the sake of example we are selecting delegate "arkland". Input your passphrase on the next line and select "NEXT".

6. In the next window you will be prompted to send Ark in order to vote, this is a voting fee required that may change over time, when you're ready to vote for your selected delegate select "SEND NOW".

7. You will now see within the "Vote" tab your delegates rank (within top 51, for this example arkland is # 19), your delegates name, their wallet address, their approval and productivity. You will also see an "UNVOTE" option which will be reviewed in the next section. You have completed voting!

### Unvoting a delegate

If your delegate is not contributing to the Ark community in a way he/she had promised, isn't paying their voters, or maybe a different delegate simply seems more attractive to you, you may wish to unvote your delegate. 

1. Within the "VOTES" tab in your wallet you will see the current delegate you are voting for. To the far right you will see "UNVOTE", select it.

2. A window will appear labeled "Remove Vote". Below that you will see your delegates name. On the next line input your passphrase. Select "NEXT". 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kYOATgj.png)

3. You will now be prompted to send the required Ark fee in order to unvote your delegate. Select "SEND NOW".

4. You will now notice your delegates name is no longer within the "VOTES" section. You have unvoted your delegate.
