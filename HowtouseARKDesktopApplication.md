___

#### What is it?

The ARK Desktop Application is the primary software that most users will utilize to store, send, receive, vote and do much more with their Ark. The desktop application/client interfaces with your wallet and allows you to interface with Ark!

This User Guide is for the everyday, non-developer Ark consumer. 

#### First things first...

We first have to download the ArkClient to get started. Start here (*if you already have the ArkClient downloaded feel free to skip to the next section to get started on the topic you're interested in learning more about*):

___

#### Identifying your Ark Wallet Address

Your Ark Wallet address is presented to you at the top of the client, under 'Address' and to the left of the *Copy* icon. This address is 100% unique to your wallet. You will need this address in the future to send Ark to your wallet. You can automatically copy is by simply clicking on it. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AlPhwoa.png)

___


### Sending Ark to your Ark Wallet (*from an exchange*)

1. First you will need to buy some Ark, which is available across many exchanges today and growing regularly. You can find a list of exchanges here:

https://ark.io/exchanges

2. Once you've purchased some Ark via an exchange you will be ready to send your Ark to your Ark Wallet.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IZ7PWYR.png)

3. In this example we are withdrawing from Bittrex. Each exchange is unique in its own way, but withdrawing will generally follow the same steps. Click on the '-' icon in Bittrex to begin your withdrawal. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zp0zKHG.png)

4. You will be presented with a 'Confirm Ark Withdrawal' page. Enter your Ark address to your wallet (simply click on the address in your Ark Desktop Application, within your wallet) and paste. Then, enter the amount of Ark you'd like to send to your Ark Wallet. Then select "Withdrawal", and "Confirm" the transaction.

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vqYrwRJ.png)</center>

**Note:** Bittrex, like many exchanges, will send you an email that you need to open and select a link in to confirm the transaction. This is a typical security measure most exchanges perform. 

5. Your Ark will be sent on it's way to your Ark Wallet! You will soon be able to see your new Ark balance in the Ark Desktop Application!

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HGIG9pu.png)

___

### Sending Ark from your Ark Wallet

Now that your have a balance of Ark in your wallet, you may want to send it out. Someone may want to send Ark to another Ark address for any number of reasons, perhaps you want to sell your Ark, pay for a good or service, or donate Ark to the Ark Community Fund. Sending Ark is quick & easy. 

1. Within your Ark Desktop Application and within your wallet, you will see an arrow pointing to the right in the top right hand corner of the Ark address box. This is the send icon. Select it. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YI4EztD.png)

2. Now you are in the send box. The 1st line you see will be the Ark address line you are *sending* your Ark to. To the left of the line is a QR Scan function. If you click it (and have a web cam hooked up to your computer) you will be able to scan the QR code of the Ark address you wish to send to and the address will automatically propagate to the Ark address line. Otherwise you will simply copy and paste the address you're sending to.

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ozzPeL6.png)</center>

3. The next line is the amount of Ark you wish to send. If you'd like to send you're entire balance select the "SEND ALL" option and your entire balance will propagate to that line.

4. Smartbridge data is not required. It can be used in specific and unique instances. Ignore it at this time.

5. The final line is where you will enter your passphrase. Your passphrase must be entered exactly as it was presented to you. It is all lower case, 12 words, 1 space between each word, and no space at the end. 

6. When you're ready to send select "NEXT". 

7. You'll now see a Transaction box, confirm all information is correct and select "SEND < > NOW"

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k9l1oKy.png)</center>

8. All done! Your Ark is on its way to its destination address!

___

### Voting with your Ark Wallet

Voting or otherwise known as staking your Ark has several purposes. By voting for a delegate you help secure the Ark network (most importantly), and the lure of voting is that most delegates provide an incentive for voting for them by rewarding you with Ark on a periodic basis (amount and how often paid differs between delegates). Some think of this as interest earned for their Ark. 

Each delegate is unique and brings different skill sets to the Ark Ecosystem, so before voting for who you think should be entrusted with securing the Ark network you should do your due diligence and research the delegates. More information about the delegates and frequently asked questions regarding voting and delegates can be found in the FAQ and Links section towards the bottom of this User Guide. 

1. Within your Ark Wallet you wish to Vote with, select the "VOTES" tab, located directly beneath your wallet address box. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c6ilspm.png)

2. You will now see a blue box that says "VOTE" within it, select it.

3. A new box will appear labeled "Vote". The first selection is a drop down labeled "Active delegates (forging)". Select it. 

4. You will now see a list of the top 51 delegates that are currently forging Ark. (*learn more about what this means in FAQ*) 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AOWHMvV.png)

5. For the sake of example we are selecting delegate "arkland". Input your passphrase on the next line and select "NEXT". 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mYmxxGc.png)

6. In the next window you will be prompted to send Ark in order to vote, this is a voting fee required that may change over time, when you're ready to vote for your selected delegate select "SEND NOW".

7. You will now see within the "Vote" tab your delegates rank (within top 51, for this example arkland is # 19), your delegates name, their wallet address, their approval and productivity. You will also see an "UNVOTE" option which will be reviewed in the next section. You have completed voting!

___


### Unvoting a delegate

If your delegate is not contributing to the Ark community in a way he/she had promised, isn't paying their voters, or maybe a different delegate simply seems more attractive to you, you may wish to unvote your delegate. 

1. Within the "VOTES" tab in your wallet you will see the current delegate you are voting for. To the far right you will see "UNVOTE", select it.

2. A window will appear labeled "Remove Vote". Below that you will see your delegates name. On the next line input your passphrase. Select "NEXT". 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kYOATgj.png)

3. You will now be prompted to send the required Ark fee in order to unvote your delegate. Select "SEND NOW".

4. You will now notice your delegates name is no longer within the "VOTES" section. You have unvoted your delegate.

___

### Various functions & featues within the Ark Client/Desktop Application

The Ark Client/Desktop Application offers a myriad of functions and features for the user to explore and utilize. This User Guide will cover and explain some of the features most often used by the average user. 

#### Appearance


___

#### Renaming your Ark Wallet

Instead of your Ark wallet address displaying on the homescreen of the Ark Client you can choose to rename/relabel your Ark wallet to what you wish. A few reasons for wanting to rename your Ark wallet could be you have multiple wallets and wish to easily distinguish between them, or perhaps you have different wallets for different purposes. 

1. Select the wallet you wish to give a new label.

2. At the top right corner of your Ark wallet address box you will see 3 vertical dots. Select it.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/x6d01DL.png)

3. You will notice a new ribbon of options appear at the bottom of your Ark Client. Select the "LABEL" option. 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CDmJYvd.png)</center>

4. A new box will appear titled "Label". You will see your current Ark address prefilled on the line. Overwrite it with what you wish to name your wallet. When you're done, select "SET". (*don't worry, this doesn't 'delete' your Ark address.*)

5. You will now see your wallet renamed to whatever you set it as. In this example we labeled it "My Main Wallet". 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5LwiPOR.png)</center>

6. If you navigate to the Ark Client homescreen (by selecting "Ark Client" in the upper left hand corner) you will also see the newly labeled wallet there. You have completed Renaming your Ark Wallet.

___

#### Adding a second passphrase

You can add a second passphrase to your Ark wallet for an added layer of security. You may want to do this if you have a large amount of Ark or if you believe somebody else may know your first passphrase (or most of it). 

**Note:** By adding a second passphrase you will be required from that point forward to use both your first and second passphrase to send transactions. You cannot remove the second passphrase once it is added and it is just as important to keep safe and kept secure as your first. This is usually not advised for the average user.

1. At the top right corner of your Ark wallet address box you will see 3 vertical dots. Select it.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/x6d01DL.png)

2. You will notice a new ribbon of options appear at the bottom of your Ark Client. Select the "SECOND PASSPHRASE" option. 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/elDLZXw.png)</center>

3. A warning box will appear advising you it will cost you 5 Ark to add a second passphrase. Select "CONTINUE".

4. A new window titled "Create Second Passphrase" will appear. The warning to copy your passphrase exactly will also be present, and below that will be your second 12 word passphrase. Copy it down exactly and verify you have down so. Select "NEXT".

5. The next window titled "Create Second Passphrase" will ask for your first passphrase and your new second passphrase. Input them and select "CREATE". 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xtefgQh.png)</center>

6. The next window will provide transaction details. To add the second passphrase select "SEND 5 ARK NOW". 

7. Your second passphrase has been added to your wallet. 

___


#### Remove wallet from Client

You may want to remove a wallet from the Ark Client if you have multiple wallets and you have some wallets you don't use anymore, or you're using a shared computer and don't want your wallets information to populate for when the next user opens Ark Client. Removing a wallet is easy and will **not** delete your wallet and it's contents. You can learn how to re-import your removed wallet in the next section. 

**Note:** If you remove your wallet from the client and later import that wallet back, any previously added labels will be gone. 

1. At the top right corner of your Ark wallet address box you will see 3 vertical dots. Select it.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/x6d01DL.png)

2. You will notice a new ribbon of options appear at the bottom of your Ark Client. Select the "REMOVE" option. 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZhmLN.png)</center>

3. A box will appear titled "Remove Account (your-ark-address)". Select "REMOVE ACCOUNT". 

4. You wallet is now removed from that Ark Client. 

___

#### Timestamp a File

With the Ark Client you can timestamp a file on the Ark blockchain. Ark Client will hash the file with SHA256. Hashing provides a unique string of characters based on the data within the file (does not include meta data). If so much as a period is removed from the file (in a text document for instance) the unique string will be vastly different. This provides proof of authenticity for the file and the timestamp provides the instance in time existed exactly as it is. This data being written to the blockchain provides immutable proof of a documents authenticity. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Xt5Abn3.png)

1. At the top right corner of your Ark wallet address box you will see 3 vertical dots. Select it.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/x6d01DL.png)

2. You will notice a new ribbon of options appear at the bottom of your Ark Client. Select the "TIMESTAMP DOCUMENT" option. 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0Ijop1i.png)</center>

3. A new box will appear titled "Timestamp Document On (wallet address)". Select "OPEN FILE" to be hashed and timestamped and select your file. Input your passphrase and select "NEXT". 

<center>![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9DG3y0i.png)</center>

4. On the next screen transaction details will be provided. Select "SEND NOW" to complete. 

5. You'll notice within your wallet transactions the SHA256 hash in the Smartbridge column, and the time & date it was committed to the blockchain in the Date column. Timestamp document complete.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

*Q: What happens if my Ark Client/Desktop Application gets deleted/uninstalled? Do I lose all my Ark?*

**A: No. You simply need to reinstall the Ark Client and re-import your wallet using your passphrase.**

*Q: What happens if I lose my passphrase? Is there any way to recover it?*

**A: No. This cannot be stressed enough, it is your responsibility to correctly copy down your passphrase and secure it to the best of your ability. If your passphrase is lost your wallet cannot send transactions and there is nothing the Ark Staff, developers or delegates can do to help you.**

*Q: If I added a second passphrase to my wallet can I still send transactions if I lost my second passphrase? Is there a way to remove the second passphrase?*

**A: If you do not know your second passphrase you will not be able to send transactions. The second passphrase is just as important as your first passphrase. However, you will be able to import your wallet with just your first passphrase and view it. But you will not be able to use the Ark in it without the second passphrase.**

*Q: How long does it take to transfer Ark to/from an exchange?*

**A: The time it takes to send Ark to/from an exchange may vary depending on how busy that exchange is. If an extensive amount of time has lapsed (days, although this should not happen) you may want to contact a delegate to assist you.**

*Q: If I am already voting for a delegate and I add more Ark to my wallet, do I need to revote for the delegate for that Ark to count?*

**A: No. Most delegates check your wallet weight on every block they forge.**

*Q: How fast are Ark blocks forged?*

**A: A block is forged every 8 seconds. Each block forged creates 2 Ark.**

*Q: When can I expect payment from my delegate?*

**A: Payment from your delegate depends on various things like the amount of Ark you're staking and their payout frequency and minimum payout amount. You can learn more about this in the delegate proposals subreddit. Link provided in Appendix.**

*Q: If I am voting for a delegate can I still send or use my Ark or is it ‘locked’ up? Do I keep my Ark when I vote?*

**A: Your Ark is not given away to the delegate nor is it locked up. It is still your Ark and you can do with it what you wish.**

*Q: Does my wallet need to be open and running for my vote to count and collect payout?*

**A: No your Ark Client does not need to be running. Simply vote for your delegate and your vote counts.**

*Q: Will timestamping my file make it viewable to others that explore the blockchain?*

**A: No, your timestamped document is not viewable to others. However, the transaction is viewable to everyone. If someone is viewing your wallet they will be able to see the transaction. (date, and hash in the Smartbridge data, but the hash is useless to them, they cannot decrypt it.)**

*Q: By adding a contact and assigning a name, will others also see that name I've given them?*

**A: No, the name you assign a wallet is unique to you and only you see it that way.**
