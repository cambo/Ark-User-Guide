Purpose: to write a high level user guide for the Ark Desktop Application/ArkClient with comprehensive instructions
complete with pictures and infographics.

Personal goal: I aimed to write this guide in a tone that was softer than most software user guides. My intended
audience is the average, everyday user that is not necassarily tech savy. I wanted to avoid the rigid and confusing nature
of a lot of other user guides out there for software. 

Result: I believe I accomplished that while also aligning my tone with how other
Ark blogs and write-ups appear. 

Reservations: Some of the questions in the FAQ section feel like they're out of scope for 
the Client User Guide. I felt the need to address some of those commonly asked questions here
but I do also think they may not belong there.
