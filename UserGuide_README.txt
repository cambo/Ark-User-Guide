Purpose: to write a high level user guide for the Ark Desktop Application/ArkClient with comprehensive instructions
complete with pictures and infographics.

Personal goal: I aimed to write this guide in a tone that was softer than most software user guides. My intended
audience is the average, everyday user that is not necassarily tech savy. I wanted to avoid the rigid and confusing nature
of a lot of other user guides out there for software. I believe I accomplished that while also aligning my tone with how other
Ark blogs and write-ups appear.
